- Players get ONE math problem and 2 minutes to solve it
- Victory = Press `=` with correct answer before time runs out
- Defeat = Calculator displays hilarious surrender message

### The Brilliant Absurdity

- **Progressive Discovery**: Learn button mappings through trial and error
- **Time Pressure**: 2 minutes to decode AND solve
- **Escalating Difficulty**: From "numbers only" to "everything lies to you"

### Difficulty Modes (The Escalating Madness)
1. **Easy**: Only numbers scrambled (operators work normally)
2. **Medium**: Numbers + operators scrambled separately  
3. **Hard**: Numbers and operators mixed together
4. **Hardcore**: Everything scrambled except delete
5. **God Tier**: Even the display lies (Easter egg mode)
